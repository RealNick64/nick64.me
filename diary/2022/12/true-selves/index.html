  <p>I was thinking about things tonight like I always do and something interesting that I thought about is the fact that there are so many layers and factors to take into account when looking at people. A lot of people define others based on factors like looks, external actions, etc. And no, I&rsquo;m not about to go Kanye mode and say Hitler was good or something. I just mean that when we look at people, we can&rsquo;t really know their true character.</p>
<p>Sure, you can get a basic idea because the traits that are the most prominent of theirs are probably on display, if that makes sense. But I suppse someone could just cover up said traits with a facade. How would I know someone is a huge golf fan without them telling me if they don&rsquo;t make it obvious through their dialogue or clothing or whatnot?</p>
<p>I feel like it is possible for someone to expose their full self and their true feelings if they really wanted to. But the issue is to make sense of something like that, you&rsquo;d have to consider their ENTIRE life and background in order for every single piece to fall into place, unless you resort to making assumptions, which isn&rsquo;t true to their own true self. There are things people hide about themselves that could probably never be revealed, for better or worse. And the traits that people do hide are always probably bad ones, whether they know for a fact those things are not acceptable by societal standards, or their own standards.</p>
<p>Is there ever <em>really</em> a way to truly know a person? I feel like the reason I bring this up is because while I never mentioned it or tried to think of it that way, subconsciously, that&rsquo;s what I made this website to do. This website acts as a somewhat personal diary, revealing aspects of myself that are true to me. I reveal my likes, dislikes, day to day activities, my fears and anxieties, and more. But even then, even if I am absolutely truthful about myself, I will never be able to fully reveal my true self to anyone, both because of things I and others would not accept, and because to include all factors of what make me myself and what factors have to be taken into account as for how I feel when I make a specific post would be pretty hard, or impossible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure what I want to say at this point anymore. I had a concept and a thought in mind, but it&rsquo;s hard to put it into words. And this thought is not something I just thought of, I&rsquo;m pretty sure everyone has. I just wanted to talk about it because I thought it was really interesting and I want to try to put my deeper more abstract thoughts into words.</p>
<p>That was really nice to type out. Have a good night, and sorry for my delusional rant.</p>
