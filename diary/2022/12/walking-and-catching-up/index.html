<p>Sorry for not writing in a while, I’ve been busy with work and finals and also doing anything but working on the website. I will write more and work on the website during my winter break, I promise. Today I walked an hour from school to home instead of just getting driven back home. It was really nice, honestly. Got to stay outside in the cold Arizona winter air and walk around, see some parts of the area I had never really seen before. I should do that more often, I think it would be nice to do.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve also been super nervous and stressed out because I had to block one of my friends. I basically was just tired of them not talking to me and all that, despite them being actively online. I mean, how does one not have 5 minutes of time to talk to someone in the span of weeks, right? This was going on for months and months, and they didn’t do anything to fix it, so I’m not gonna do anything to keep things going either. There’s much more to it than that, but that’s not really in the scope of this catch-up post. I just wanted to share it because it’s something that’s been nagging at me for a few days now.</p>
<p>I hope to write less bloaty content for the website, and I also want to add more things to it. I don’t want to bloat (I say “bloat” a lot, huh?) the website with random garbage, but I want stuff that I think would be fun to include, so I’m just brainstorming stuff right now. If anyone is actually reading this, you can also e-mail me ideas or DM me on Discord or something. But yeah, hopefully new things will come in the future.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for reading, and I hope you have a good day :)</p>
