					So, you want to watch Neon Genesis Evangelion. You may be asking "What
					is Neon Genesis Evangelion?"
				</p>
				<br />
				<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
				<p>
					Neon Genesis Evangelion is a show created in 1995 by Gainax and
					directed by Hideaki Anno. The show is 26 episodes long and also has 2
					movies (which I'll talk about later!). It's been revered by critics
					for its themes and characters, which I wholeheartedly agree with, it's
					really a show that makes you think a lot (maybe a little too much
					sometimes haha!).
				</p>
				<br />
				<p><b>Why is it good?</b></p>
				<p>
					The show itself, while being a mecha anime like Mobile Suit Gundam
					Wing, has a lot more going for it with its religious undertones and
					focus on the charcter development of characters like Shinji and Asuka
					&#60;3 (although Misato is cool too). It provides the viewer with a
					surreal experience that no other anime has done good yet (like Serial
					Experiments Lain, I'll talk about you later).
