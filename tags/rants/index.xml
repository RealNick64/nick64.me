      <description>Well… it’s been a year, hasn’t it? I think it’s time I reflected on myself and what I’ve done the whole year.
I think this year’s been okay, not great, not bad, but okay. I’ve met some new people this year that I’m really grateful to have in my life. I’ve also done a lot of things I regret. A lot of people have, it’s not just me, but I feel like this year I feel like I’ve been deceiving myself in believing I’ve changed as a person, but in reality, I was just sort of ignoring my faults and pretending that I had fixed things, when in reality I didn’t change at all.</description>

      <description>It depends. That&amp;rsquo;s a really unconclusive answer, sorry.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of how much effort you want to put into it and what you want to use it for.
For me, I did it because I wanted a place to post whatever I wanted to, like stupid rants or art or whatnot. It also gives me an outlet to be more creative about my profile, instead of a place like Twitter where it&amp;rsquo;s simply just the profile picture, background, and profile text, and that&amp;rsquo;s it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure somebody already used that pun but still.
About a couple of days before posting for the first time on this blog, during Black Friday Week, I finally gave into Kindle shilling after wanting to do something about not reading and bought a Kindle Paperwhite 2021 model off of Amazon for 100 dollarinos.
For a bit, I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it at all.
Yeah, I guess it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea to get a Kindle unless I had the intention to read in the first place.</description>
