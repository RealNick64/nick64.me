      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I undervolted the CPU on my home server, so now I can save a little bit more moneyz on power!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img style=&#34;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;max-width:600px;max-height:auto;&#34; src=&#34;http://nick64.me/images/yippee-happy.gif&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s neat, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also plan on upgrading the drives in the future so that I have more space for awesome doodads (pirated movies and TV shows heheheha), and for backup storage too. Not only that, I also want to try to use the server for more things, like setting up Searx or a home VPN for places that I can&amp;rsquo;t use ExpressVPN at (like school or smth idk). Even if it won&amp;rsquo;t be that useful, it&amp;rsquo;ll be a fun and enlightening experience for me, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s what matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good night, guys! :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kindle: Rekindling My Desire to Read</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure somebody already used that pun but still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a couple of days before posting for the first time on this blog, during Black Friday Week, I finally gave into Kindle shilling after wanting to do something about not reading and bought a Kindle Paperwhite 2021 model off of Amazon for 100 dollarinos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a bit, I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I guess it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea to get a Kindle unless I had the intention to read in the first place. One issue I had when getting it was how difficult it is to read just regular chapters of manga on the Kindle. Instead, reading volumes of manga is more convenient since they&amp;rsquo;re all compiled and stuff. After a while though, I finally got other books, mainly Akira and Infinite Jest on there, although I do plan on getting other books on there as well. I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched Infinite Jest too much since its like 1000 pages and it&amp;rsquo;s sort of intimidating (although I&amp;rsquo;ll get to it eventually I promise), but I did start Akira, and the experience is very good. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading before I go to bed, so the blue light feature really helps a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, don&amp;rsquo;t buy shit you don&amp;rsquo;t know if you&amp;rsquo;ll need for sure, but I think this ended up going well for me and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I bought the Kindle, because at least now I have more motivation to read unlike before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy a Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must please Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodnight :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I was hoping this kinda wouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen. You know how you can&amp;rsquo;t use personality #27 in front of friend group #5? Well, this website being on my Discord exposed it. Was kinda hoping this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen, but not much I can do now. If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this (you know who you are), uh…. Hi. Hope your day&amp;rsquo;s been good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, here&amp;rsquo;s a cool song that I wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BHa5Qs9KK0g&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it a lot. Maybe I should share more music I like every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Confrontation</title>
      <link>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/confrontation/</link>

      <guid>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/confrontation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been too good with confronting people for anything, really. I’ve always been kind of a coward. I don’t like speaking out about issues, because I don’t want to cause problems for myself or make other people mad. But even without confronting things, I still feel like I make things worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I think I made someone mad at me. I… don’t like this person. I feel obligated to hang out with them because I don’t want them to be mad at me and we’ve been friends for a while. But I don’t like being with him because while he’s not a perfect person, nobody is, he can be kind of… problematic sometimes. He has lots of drama with other people, and that’s not my problem, but I just don’t agree with him and his ways. Not to mention, it… doesn’t feel like he takes me seriously. If I ever actually want to do something, like show him a song I like, or show him a video, he just pushes me off. I think that’s on me though, since I’ve always been a somewhat chaotic jokester of a person. I guess it’s my facade to make people notice me, or something, and because of that, no one takes me seriously. But today, I didn’t feel like talking to him. I wanted to tell him why. But I didn’t. I said nothing to him. We were sitting at lunch and I gave him the cold shoulder when he came. I said nothing. He said nothing. Before lunch ended, he left, shoving the chair into the table and walking out. I don’t want to make him mad. I don’t want to make anyone mad. But my coldness and inability to speak out also helps nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not even just other people it hurts. It hurts me too. There is a girl that I wanted to talk to. We’ve been friends for a while, had some drama here and there, but we’ve been on good terms for a while now. I want to keep things going. I want to talk to her. But she’s always so busy. I can’t blame her for being busy, but I don’t understand how she doesn’t respond to me for 2 whole weeks. I don’t even care about having a full conversation, I just want to hear from her again, but somehow she can’t give up 5 minutes out of any of her days to talk to me, even though it’s clear that it’s not like she’s busy &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time. It’s not like she hates me either… I think.  She seems to care about me somewhat. Or at least, she did. My point is I’m doing my best to keep things going and she’s doing… nothing. I wanted to bring this up with her, and I have before. Several times. Last time I did, I was kind of immature about it, I didn’t like the way I brought it up. And when she talked about it, I just… caved in. I gave up and decided to blame it all on myself. It wasn’t her fault that she isn’t on and never talks to me and I’m upset, it’s because I’m selfish and she has SOOOO MUCH TO DO ALLLL THE TIME. IT’S MY FAULT FOR BRINGING IT UP ALL THE TIME, NOT HERS FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING TO KEEP THINGS GOING.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I keep blaming myself for this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I cave in whenever there’s the slightest risk of upsetting people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can’t I just speak my thoughts with no hesitation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do people have to be so hard to deal with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m tired of people honestly. I’m tired of friends. Not all of them, of course. But right now, I don’t like how things are for myself. For the people I like. The people I talk to. I’m just sick of having to deal with the frustration of keeping things in. Maybe it’s not my fault for people having problems. But it is my fault for keeping my mouth shut.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are people I would not like to be associated with that are actively making me feel worse and I do not want to be involved with them. Why do I feel this way&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Realized that I didn&amp;rsquo;t post yesterday. Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind too much because I think I want to try to actually make good content rather than fulfil a deadline and make shitposts. Anyways, today was a wild day, I saw a hit and run with a guy on a motorcycle and other stuff too, it was kinda chaotic and I think I need to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to posting, I might start not posting as often so that I have time to craft better posts. Maybe I will still shitpost since it&amp;rsquo;s fun but I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Next post might be a review of something. Not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hugo or Jekyll?</title>
      <link>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/hugo-or-jekyll/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m debating whether I should go through the effort of learning Jekyll and porting my site to that, or sticking with Hugo. I heard from my good friend realjame that Jekyll (the gen he uses for his blog) is better to him after he tried using Hugo because of the convenience of the tools, but it could just be that he&amp;rsquo;s used to it. I&amp;rsquo;ll think on this a little more. In the meantime, I should worry about more important things like school, since finals are starting now for me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Not Really Feeling It Today</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wanted to write a lot earlier, but honestly I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like it right now, I&amp;rsquo;m just kind of burnt out from working on my art stuff and just doing nothing. Good night.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More Rain</title>
      <link>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/more-rain/</link>

      <guid>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/more-rain/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a really nice day. It actually rained a lot more than I thought, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d only rain for the morning, but it rained the whole day, which was really refreshing and set a good mood for me. I also worked on the website and fixed some RSS stuff, worked on my new project (which I won&amp;rsquo;t say much about right now hehe), and also got more letters from colleges. One college sent me a &amp;ldquo;handwritten&amp;rdquo; letter that was just printed for the whole message except for my name on the top. The address was written too, but they spelt my name wrong. How special. It was good though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I also watched Blair Witch Project. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to open my horizons when it comes to movies since I never watched a lot as a kid, but I liked it a lot. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a lot of movies and getting into new stuff recently in order to give myself a broader sense of my own self and the world. Hopefully it helps with coming up with inspritation for projects I want to make, but A) I have major commitment issues when it comes to those, and B) I&amp;rsquo;m getting off-topic here. Blair Witch Project was really good, the style of it was unique and helped set a good atmosphere, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that YouTube horror series and other stuff has conditioned me to fear old 4:3 analog video, so it made it that much more scary hahaha&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it was a great day. I hope you reading this right now had one too. And if not, things will get better! Hopefully. Kidding, haha. Anyways, good night. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a beautiful rainy day where I’m at right now. No sunlight, all clouds, rain pouring down. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is a nice day for me. I personally don’t like the sun too much. Especially here in Arizona, where it gets so hot and all. When it rains, it’s really refreshing, especially growing up in Washington, where there’s a lot more rain than here. I think a reason I like the rain more is just the atmosphere of it. Rain is honestly really beautiful to me, something about the tippity tappity of the rain on the earth and grayness of the clouds and the amplified coziness of my home now that I’m sheltered from the rain feels really nice. Sunlight is fine too, but I don’t find it all that interesting. Maybe it’s just because I’m saying this as someone who goes outside a lot, but only really for school and work and other stuff, I don’t go out for the sake of going out a lot, so I don’t enjoy things like that. But oh well. Anyways, just wanted to write about that because I really enjoy this day of rain. I hope all of you reading this enjoy your days too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For real though, no more weird posts for a sec. Sorry for not saying a lot recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with school and work and&amp;hellip; life, in general. I want to work on the website, and I will still be posting daily here, but fixes and adding new stuff will be kind of slow for a while. I hope to get to it as soon as possible, but at the same time, I also need to work on other projects as well. I wanted to use this website to host said projects, so I should probably get to them now that I have a site to put them on lol. I should also post more art here from my old Twitter sometime. But yeah, have a wonderful day guys, and to those reading, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Time Watching Evangelion 3.0 &#43; 1.0: Thrice Upon a Time in IMAX.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was mid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me clarify. I&amp;hellip; like this movie. Not a lot, but I like it. I think watching it in theaters has made me appreciate some aspects of the movie a lot, some of the scenes were really cool to see in theaters (especially the scene of Asuka trying to penetrate Unit 13) and the music was really cool and epic to hear, but the IMAX presentation felt somewhat&amp;hellip; lacking, I guess? It didn&amp;rsquo;t feel as punchy as I had hoped. And all these things also don&amp;rsquo;t help with the story of the movie itself and how things go, which I have quite a few issues with some parts, mainly the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it a waste of 2 hours and 45 minutes of my life? No, not at all. Would I willingly watch it again? No. At most, I&amp;rsquo;ll buy the Blu-ray once it comes out so I can complete my Evangelion Blu-ray collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sad to see that this is the end of Evangelion though&amp;hellip; supposedly. Knowing how much of a cash cow Evangelion is, it inevitably will return somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

Just wanted to make that post real quick. I&amp;rsquo;ll write some more later today, I&amp;rsquo;m about to go watch Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 in IMAX, so yay&amp;hellip; End of Evangelion is still better. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh man, oh man, I bought a Sega Genesis for 16 dollars today at Goodwill. Opened it up to get a look-see inside and oh my&amp;hellip; old hardware and huge chips are so hot&amp;hellip; I really dig the look of the internals. Something about the humongous 68000 CPU and the SEGA chips and the Zilog CPU, MAN! It is so AWESOME AND HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT. Old hardware is my fetish.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So my old Twitter handle got banned because I was under 13 when I made the account. I set my real birthday on it because I was revamping my profile and uhh yeah. Fuck you, Elon Musk, give me back my account :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, I’ll just make a new account, with a new handle and everything. Maybe I’ll expand to other sites like Instagram or something so I can spread my site around somehow, I don’t know…. I’ll update with a new post when I get my Twitter stuff figured out, but honestly I don’t really care enough to panic about it right now and fix everything, I have better things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally got the Gurren Lagann box set in my mail today after ordering it on the RightStufAnime Black Friday sale and waiting a week for it to arrive. Being my first Aniplex box set, DAMN was it expensive. But it was worth it, it&amp;rsquo;s really nice. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished the series yet but I wanted it because it was fire. Will waste more moneyz on future box sets in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the intro video here :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Have a Melancholy Christmas...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite what marketing wants me to think, &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; Thanksgiving will always be the start of Christmas and the winter season. Except the &amp;ldquo;hype&amp;rdquo; for me is&amp;hellip; strange. I do feel genuinely excited for Christmas because the mood of the holiday is really nice and cozy for me. But at the same time, it also feels somewhat depressing too. Something about Christmas and the winter season, while I like, makes me feel melancholic as well. Winter is my favorite season, period. But somehow it makes me feel alone as well. When I think about Christmas, I think about being with your family and friends, and I have family, but friends&amp;hellip; not really. At least, not in person. I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Arizona for about 2 and a half years now as a former Washington resident. Since then, while it was really hard for me to get adjusted most of the time being here, in recent times, I have begun to make friends, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel any sort of deep personal connection for any of them (no offense to you guys if you&amp;rsquo;re somehow reading this). The only people I really feel connected to are all online, either being my old school/church friends or friends I met through Discord. And I don&amp;rsquo;t want to exclude them or discount them by any means since they mean a lot to me, but I do feel the need for in-person relationships more than online. Something about the feeling of having the people you love in-person with you feels really good to me. It&amp;rsquo;s nice. It&amp;rsquo;s comforting. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have that now. And for a lot of people, the things that define what Christmas is to them may not be that, but for me, that&amp;rsquo;s a defining aspect of it. Anyways, sorry for going on a tangent about this. It was an attempt to contextualize and externalize how I feel about Christmas. This probably won&amp;rsquo;t be the last time I discuss my social situation though. To whoever reads this, I hope you have a wonderful winter and a wonderful rest of your day :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Yawning!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m about to go to work, but this was a thought I had for a bit every once in a while. My boss will sometimes say not to do something, and somehow, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how he does it, he sounds serious, but also sounds like he&amp;rsquo;s joking at the same time. The past few times he&amp;rsquo;s done this to me, I was yawning because I work later in the day, and he said &amp;ldquo;No yawning!&amp;rdquo; in that same way I mentioned before. I genuinely can&amp;rsquo;t tell if he seriously means it or not. It sounds like such a silly thing to not allow, but at the same time that feels like something that would be frowned on by the higher ups of where I work at (a retail store, for context). I&amp;rsquo;m about to go into work in half an hour, but I just wanted to write about it because it was sort of confusing and I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what to think of it, haha&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s just a funny thing to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genesis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I created this shitty website. Thus the homepage and the template were completed in their subpar looks. By the twenty-seventh day I had finished the work I had been doing; so on the twenty-seventh day I rested forever and ever from all this work. Then I blessed the twenty-seventh day and made it awesome, because on it I rested from all the work of creating I had done by watching anime and YouTube the whole day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, yeah this is the first post on my blog. I wish it was more monumental, but honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not even writing this for anyone more than I am writing it for myself. This post is just kickstarting the blog, more or less. I plan on writing here daily, or at least, as daily as I can handle, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how well that commitment goes. But right now, the site isn&amp;rsquo;t even live at the time of posting, so who knows when it&amp;rsquo;ll go online so that others can see posts like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, for anyone who may or may not be reading this, enjoy the website. It&amp;rsquo;s still under construction, but I&amp;rsquo;m gonna do my best to make it really good and fun to browse. I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding more over time and also begin posting other stuff like art and other projects here (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next post :)&lt;/p&gt;
