  <p>In the beginning, I created this shitty website. Thus the homepage and the template were completed in their subpar looks. By the twenty-seventh day I had finished the work I had been doing; so on the twenty-seventh day I rested forever and ever from all this work. Then I blessed the twenty-seventh day and made it awesome, because on it I rested from all the work of creating I had done by watching anime and YouTube the whole day.</p>
<p>Anyways, yeah this is the first post on my blog. I wish it was more monumental, but honestly, I&rsquo;m not even writing this for anyone more than I am writing it for myself. This post is just kickstarting the blog, more or less. I plan on writing here daily, or at least, as daily as I can handle, but we&rsquo;ll see how well that commitment goes. But right now, the site isn&rsquo;t even live at the time of posting, so who knows when it&rsquo;ll go online so that others can see posts like this.</p>
<p>Anyways, for anyone who may or may not be reading this, enjoy the website. It&rsquo;s still under construction, but I&rsquo;m gonna do my best to make it really good and fun to browse. I&rsquo;ll be adding more over time and also begin posting other stuff like art and other projects here (hopefully).</p>
<p>See you next post :)</p>
