      <description>Ok, so I was going to write some big thing about why VR as a platform is bad, but the more I think about it, I think it’s just a matter of preference than anything. So instead of writing the worst criticisms possible about VR, I’ll just explain why I personally don’t like it.
The biggest one is more of a problem on my end than anything else, motion sickness. Some people have issues with this in VR, some don’t.</description>

      <description>Today I undervolted the CPU on my home server, so now I can save a little bit more moneyz on power!
That&amp;rsquo;s neat, I guess.
Also plan on upgrading the drives in the future so that I have more space for awesome doodads (pirated movies and TV shows heheheha), and for backup storage too. Not only that, I also want to try to use the server for more things, like setting up Searx or a home VPN for places that I can&amp;rsquo;t use ExpressVPN at (like school or smth idk).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure somebody already used that pun but still.
About a couple of days before posting for the first time on this blog, during Black Friday Week, I finally gave into Kindle shilling after wanting to do something about not reading and bought a Kindle Paperwhite 2021 model off of Amazon for 100 dollarinos.
For a bit, I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it at all.
Yeah, I guess it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea to get a Kindle unless I had the intention to read in the first place.</description>
