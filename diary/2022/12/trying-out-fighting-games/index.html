  <p>When Smash Bros Ultimate preorders went live, I preordered immediately. I wasn&rsquo;t even into Smash Bros, I just really wanted to get into it, so I bought it in the hopes of finally fitting in with my friends who all played Smash Bros. And how did that go?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t touched the game in years.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to get into it for the longest time. They seem really fun, and the kinda stuff I&rsquo;d be into, but I was really intimidated by all the technical terms players were throwing around and their skills. It put me off of getting into them for a while, but today I checked Steam and said, &ldquo;Hey, why not?&rdquo;, so I bought a couple of fighting games, but the one I&rsquo;m mainly kinda hooked on right now is Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late. It&rsquo;s fun, but I really suck at the game, which is to be expected since I never played anything much prior. I think I&rsquo;m finally beginning to understand a little and I&rsquo;ve gotten slightly better at it. I&rsquo;m just playing Hyde and I kinda learned the basics of the gameplay and moves and stuff. I finally got my first CPU win after like 30-40 minutes of playing around with it. It&rsquo;s fun, but I hope I can manage to make myself stick to playing them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I hate them, like I said, I&rsquo;m just bad at them and somewhat intimidated. But that&rsquo;s what practice is for, right?</p>
<p>Well, it was fun to play that. I guess I also did get Spider-Man Remastered, but that&rsquo;s not a fighting game, I just wanted to add that since I bought these games because I was buying that and it was the Steam Winter Sale. I&rsquo;ll get to playing that soon as well, I played like the first 20 minutes of it so far&hellip;.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;m gonna head to work, have a good day!</p>
