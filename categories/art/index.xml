      <description>Made this promo while listening to the track in the video, thought of this, and made it this morning. Honestly pretty proud of it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it really fits in with the style of Adult Swim promos. Maybe a little. I don&amp;rsquo;t know.
Enjoy.</description>

My new friend He&amp;rsquo;s a little bit shy, so please be nice. He likes playing tic-tac-toe and drinking Dr Pepper!</description>

      <description>Made this sketch today, I think there are obviously some faults because I am in no way an expert at art or anything, but I&#39;m honestly just proud of the progress I&#39;m making. Granted, I did use a reference, but no tracing or anything, so I&#39;m happy. I need to keep doing these so I can properly understand human proportions and draw better. </description>
