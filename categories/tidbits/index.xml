      <title>Playstation Stuff and Website Stuff Too, I Guess</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry I haven&amp;rsquo;t been posting in a bit, I&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with drama and also just not feeling in the writing mood for a second there (maybe I should write about those things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny how after the PlayStation 2 post, I played a little bit more on the PS2, but not by much. Also, my GBS-Control died because of how shit of a job I did with the making of it, I plugged it in and it had a lil&amp;rsquo; puff of smoke come out of it. Oops. I want to play on the PS2 more though, so I brought out a CRT to play on it. It&amp;rsquo;s not an excellent CRT, but it does the job. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna play Persona 3 on it and also probably try to get better at Parappa 2, but I want to play more games on it as well. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also wanted to make a post on the PSP, but I can&amp;rsquo;t actually find my charger for it for some reason and it&amp;rsquo;s completely dead. USB charging doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work either, I think I disabled it or something. I will probably work on that soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been working on a small comic. I have a really bad track record of not commiting to my projects, so I won&amp;rsquo;t say anything about it until I release it here on my website. I would say look forward to it, but you might disappoint yourself if you do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been working on the website too as well, I was experiementing around with new looks for it, but I&amp;rsquo;m not very good at writing CSS or HTML, so honestly it might be while before I come up with something that I want to put in while looking stylish and nice. But I do have plans for renovation, and I still want to implement those new ideas I was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, thanks for reading, and hope to write here again soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Widdle Pwecious Home Server</title>
      <link>https://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/my-widdle-pwecious-home-server/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I undervolted the CPU on my home server, so now I can save a little bit more moneyz on power!&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;img style=&#34;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;max-width:600px;max-height:auto;&#34; src=&#34;images/yippee-happy.gif&#34;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s neat, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also plan on upgrading the drives in the future so that I have more space for awesome doodads (pirated movies and TV shows heheheha), and for backup storage too. Not only that, I also want to try to use the server for more things, like setting up Searx or a home VPN for places that I can&amp;rsquo;t use ExpressVPN at (like school or smth idk). Even if it won&amp;rsquo;t be that useful, it&amp;rsquo;ll be a fun and enlightening experience for me, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s what matters most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good night, guys! :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unexpected Visitors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I was hoping this kinda wouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen. You know how you can&amp;rsquo;t use personality #27 in front of friend group #5? Well, this website being on my Discord exposed it. Was kinda hoping this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen, but not much I can do now. If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this (you know who you are), uhâ€¦. Hi. Hope your day&amp;rsquo;s been good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, here&amp;rsquo;s a cool song that I wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BHa5Qs9KK0g&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it a lot. Maybe I should share more music I like every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are people I would not like to be associated with that are actively making me feel worse and I do not want to be involved with them. Why do I feel this way&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hugo or Jekyll?</title>
      <link>https://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/hugo-or-jekyll/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m debating whether I should go through the effort of learning Jekyll and porting my site to that, or sticking with Hugo. I heard from my good friend realjame that Jekyll (the gen he uses for his blog) is better to him after he tried using Hugo because of the convenience of the tools, but it could just be that he&amp;rsquo;s used to it. I&amp;rsquo;ll think on this a little more. In the meantime, I should worry about more important things like school, since finals are starting now for me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wanted to write a lot earlier, but honestly I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like it right now, I&amp;rsquo;m just kind of burnt out from working on my art stuff and just doing nothing. Good night.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh man, oh man, I bought a Sega Genesis for 16 dollars today at Goodwill. Opened it up to get a look-see inside and oh my&amp;hellip; old hardware and huge chips are so hot&amp;hellip; I really dig the look of the internals. Something about the humongous 68000 CPU and the SEGA chips and the Zilog CPU, MAN! It is so AWESOME AND HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT. Old hardware is my fetish.&lt;/p&gt;
