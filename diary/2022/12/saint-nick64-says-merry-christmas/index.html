  <p>Well, this is sort of late, but I just wanted to say Merry Christmas to all reading!</p>
<p>I hope you did something fun today, perhaps hang out with your family, or something. I spent some time with my family walking and eating lunch at the table today, which are two things my family as a whole don&rsquo;t do often. I love my family, but I do feel bad about how we sometimes feel really disconnected from each other. I&rsquo;ve been trying harder to get closer and do more with them.</p>
<p>I feel like the feeling I get from Christmas only happens in the first hour or so of the day, when me and my family open their presents. After that, it just feels like a normal day. I think it&rsquo;s because of the fact that we don&rsquo;t do a lot on Christmas since I don&rsquo;t have any family where I live, so no places to visit, or even friends here to visit, since everyone is out of state. Oh well&hellip;</p>
<p>Just wanted to write a little. I&rsquo;ll probably write more soon since I have some ideas of things to write about. Also site updates too, with visuals and all. Well, Merry Christmas, fellow reader!</p>
