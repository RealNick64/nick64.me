      <description>It was mid.
Let me clarify. I&amp;hellip; like this movie. Not a lot, but I like it. I think watching it in theaters has made me appreciate some aspects of the movie a lot, some of the scenes were really cool to see in theaters (especially the scene of Asuka trying to penetrate Unit 13) and the music was really cool and epic to hear, but the IMAX presentation felt somewhat&amp;hellip; lacking, I guess?</description>

      <description>Got a new Twitter, so woohoo&amp;hellip; and hey, I also made a new email! Both are in the &amp;ldquo;Contacts&amp;rdquo; tab if you want to contact me. Just wanted to make that post real quick. I&amp;rsquo;ll write some more later today, I&amp;rsquo;m about to go watch Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 in IMAX, so yay&amp;hellip; End of Evangelion is still better. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk more on that later.</description>

      <description>Oh man, oh man, I bought a Sega Genesis for 16 dollars today at Goodwill. Opened it up to get a look-see inside and oh my&amp;hellip; old hardware and huge chips are so hot&amp;hellip; I really dig the look of the internals. Something about the humongous 68000 CPU and the SEGA chips and the Zilog CPU, MAN! It is so AWESOME AND HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT. Old hardware is my fetish.</description>

      <description>So my old Twitter handle got banned because I was under 13 when I made the account. I set my real birthday on it because I was revamping my profile and uhh yeah. Fuck you, Elon Musk, give me back my account :(
In reality, I’ll just make a new account, with a new handle and everything. Maybe I’ll expand to other sites like Instagram or something so I can spread my site around somehow, I don’t know….</description>

      <description>Finally got the Gurren Lagann box set in my mail today after ordering it on the RightStufAnime Black Friday sale and waiting a week for it to arrive. Being my first Aniplex box set, DAMN was it expensive. But it was worth it, it&amp;rsquo;s really nice. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished the series yet but I wanted it because it was fire. Will waste more moneyz on future box sets in the future.</description>

      <title>Have a Melancholy Christmas...</title>

      <description>Despite what marketing wants me to think, after Thanksgiving will always be the start of Christmas and the winter season. Except the &amp;ldquo;hype&amp;rdquo; for me is&amp;hellip; strange. I do feel genuinely excited for Christmas because the mood of the holiday is really nice and cozy for me. But at the same time, it also feels somewhat depressing too. Something about Christmas and the winter season, while I like, makes me feel melancholic as well.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m about to go to work, but this was a thought I had for a bit every once in a while. My boss will sometimes say not to do something, and somehow, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how he does it, he sounds serious, but also sounds like he&amp;rsquo;s joking at the same time. The past few times he&amp;rsquo;s done this to me, I was yawning because I work later in the day, and he said &amp;ldquo;No yawning!</description>

      <description>In the beginning, I created this shitty website. Thus the homepage and the template were completed in their subpar looks. By the twenty-seventh day I had finished the work I had been doing; so on the twenty-seventh day I rested forever and ever from all this work. Then I blessed the twenty-seventh day and made it awesome, because on it I rested from all the work of creating I had done by watching anime and YouTube the whole day.</description>

I want to thank my friends for being there and supporting me, I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have them in my life and they mean a lot to me and without them, I imagine things would be different (in a bad way).
Also want to thank realjame of realja.me for helping me by giving me tips and advice for making the website and also giving me the idea to make a website for blogging and art stuff (thanks j).</description>
