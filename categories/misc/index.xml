      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was mid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me clarify. I&amp;hellip; like this movie. Not a lot, but I like it. I think watching it in theaters has made me appreciate some aspects of the movie a lot, some of the scenes were really cool to see in theaters (especially the scene of Asuka trying to penetrate Unit 13) and the music was really cool and epic to hear, but the IMAX presentation felt somewhat&amp;hellip; lacking, I guess? It didn&amp;rsquo;t feel as punchy as I had hoped. And all these things also don&amp;rsquo;t help with the story of the movie itself and how things go, which I have quite a few issues with some parts, mainly the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it a waste of 2 hours and 45 minutes of my life? No, not at all. Would I willingly watch it again? No. At most, I&amp;rsquo;ll buy the Blu-ray once it comes out so I can complete my Evangelion Blu-ray collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sad to see that this is the end of Evangelion though&amp;hellip; supposedly. Knowing how much of a cash cow Evangelion is, it inevitably will return somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally got the Gurren Lagann box set in my mail today after ordering it on the RightStufAnime Black Friday sale and waiting a week for it to arrive. Being my first Aniplex box set, DAMN was it expensive. But it was worth it, it&amp;rsquo;s really nice. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished the series yet but I wanted it because it was fire. Will waste more moneyz on future box sets in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the intro video here :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Have a Melancholy Christmas...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite what marketing wants me to think, &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; Thanksgiving will always be the start of Christmas and the winter season. Except the &amp;ldquo;hype&amp;rdquo; for me is&amp;hellip; strange. I do feel genuinely excited for Christmas because the mood of the holiday is really nice and cozy for me. But at the same time, it also feels somewhat depressing too. Something about Christmas and the winter season, while I like, makes me feel melancholic as well. Winter is my favorite season, period. But somehow it makes me feel alone as well. When I think about Christmas, I think about being with your family and friends, and I have family, but friends&amp;hellip; not really. At least, not in person. I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Arizona for about 2 and a half years now as a former Washington resident. Since then, while it was really hard for me to get adjusted most of the time being here, in recent times, I have begun to make friends, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel any sort of deep personal connection for any of them (no offense to you guys if you&amp;rsquo;re somehow reading this). The only people I really feel connected to are all online, either being my old school/church friends or friends I met through Discord. And I don&amp;rsquo;t want to exclude them or discount them by any means since they mean a lot to me, but I do feel the need for in-person relationships more than online. Something about the feeling of having the people you love in-person with you feels really good to me. It&amp;rsquo;s nice. It&amp;rsquo;s comforting. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have that now. And for a lot of people, the things that define what Christmas is to them may not be that, but for me, that&amp;rsquo;s a defining aspect of it. Anyways, sorry for going on a tangent about this. It was an attempt to contextualize and externalize how I feel about Christmas. This probably won&amp;rsquo;t be the last time I discuss my social situation though. To whoever reads this, I hope you have a wonderful winter and a wonderful rest of your day :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Yawning!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m about to go to work, but this was a thought I had for a bit every once in a while. My boss will sometimes say not to do something, and somehow, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how he does it, he sounds serious, but also sounds like he&amp;rsquo;s joking at the same time. The past few times he&amp;rsquo;s done this to me, I was yawning because I work later in the day, and he said &amp;ldquo;No yawning!&amp;rdquo; in that same way I mentioned before. I genuinely can&amp;rsquo;t tell if he seriously means it or not. It sounds like such a silly thing to not allow, but at the same time that feels like something that would be frowned on by the higher ups of where I work at (a retail store, for context). I&amp;rsquo;m about to go into work in half an hour, but I just wanted to write about it because it was sort of confusing and I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what to think of it, haha&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s just a funny thing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
