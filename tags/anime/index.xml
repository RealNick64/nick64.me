      <description>Wow, okay, it’s about time I finished watching this show.
Last night, I finally finished Gurren Lagann. I thought it was really good! I liked it a lot, and I’m glad I bought the Blu-ray set. I’m not gonna write an in-depth review or anything, just some quick thoughts I have about the show.
SPOILERS AHEAD!!! First of all, I really like the style of the show and the atmosphere it sets up.</description>

      <description>It was mid.
Let me clarify. I&amp;hellip; like this movie. Not a lot, but I like it. I think watching it in theaters has made me appreciate some aspects of the movie a lot, some of the scenes were really cool to see in theaters (especially the scene of Asuka trying to penetrate Unit 13) and the music was really cool and epic to hear, but the IMAX presentation felt somewhat&amp;hellip; lacking, I guess?</description>

      <description>Finally got the Gurren Lagann box set in my mail today after ordering it on the RightStufAnime Black Friday sale and waiting a week for it to arrive. Being my first Aniplex box set, DAMN was it expensive. But it was worth it, it&amp;rsquo;s really nice. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished the series yet but I wanted it because it was fire. Will waste more moneyz on future box sets in the future.</description>
