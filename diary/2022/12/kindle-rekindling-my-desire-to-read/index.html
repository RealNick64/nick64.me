  <p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure somebody already used that pun but still.</p>
<p>About a couple of days before posting for the first time on this blog, during Black Friday Week, I finally gave into Kindle shilling after wanting to do something about not reading and bought a Kindle Paperwhite 2021 model off of Amazon for 100 dollarinos.</p>
<p>For a bit, I didn&rsquo;t use it at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess it wasn&rsquo;t a good idea to get a Kindle unless I had the intention to read in the first place. One issue I had when getting it was how difficult it is to read just regular chapters of manga on the Kindle. Instead, reading volumes of manga is more convenient since they&rsquo;re all compiled and stuff. After a while though, I finally got other books, mainly Akira and Infinite Jest on there, although I do plan on getting other books on there as well. I haven&rsquo;t touched Infinite Jest too much since its like 1000 pages and it&rsquo;s sort of intimidating (although I&rsquo;ll get to it eventually I promise), but I did start Akira, and the experience is very good. I&rsquo;ve been reading before I go to bed, so the blue light feature really helps a lot.</p>
<p>Overall, don&rsquo;t buy shit you don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ll need for sure, but I think this ended up going well for me and I&rsquo;m glad I bought the Kindle, because at least now I have more motivation to read unlike before.</p>
<p>Buy a Kindle.</p>
<p>You must please Jeff Bezos.</p>
<p>Goodnight :)</p>
