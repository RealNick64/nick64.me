      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry I haven&amp;rsquo;t been posting in a bit, I&amp;rsquo;ve been dealing with drama and also just not feeling in the writing mood for a second there (maybe I should write about those things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny how after the PlayStation 2 post, I played a little bit more on the PS2, but not by much. Also, my GBS-Control died because of how shit of a job I did with the making of it, I plugged it in and it had a lil&amp;rsquo; puff of smoke come out of it. Oops. I want to play on the PS2 more though, so I brought out a CRT to play on it. It&amp;rsquo;s not an excellent CRT, but it does the job. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna play Persona 3 on it and also probably try to get better at Parappa 2, but I want to play more games on it as well. We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also wanted to make a post on the PSP, but I can&amp;rsquo;t actually find my charger for it for some reason and it&amp;rsquo;s completely dead. USB charging doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work either, I think I disabled it or something. I will probably work on that soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been working on a small comic. I have a really bad track record of not commiting to my projects, so I won&amp;rsquo;t say anything about it until I release it here on my website. I would say look forward to it, but you might disappoint yourself if you do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been working on the website too as well, I was experiementing around with new looks for it, but I&amp;rsquo;m not very good at writing CSS or HTML, so honestly it might be while before I come up with something that I want to put in while looking stylish and nice. But I do have plans for renovation, and I still want to implement those new ideas I was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, thanks for reading, and hope to write here again soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Walking and Catching Up</title>

    &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for not writing in a while, I’ve been busy with work and finals and also doing anything but working on the website. I will write more and work on the website during my winter break, I promise. Today I walked an hour from school to home instead of just getting driven back home. It was really nice, honestly. Got to stay outside in the cold Arizona winter air and walk around, see some parts of the area I had never really seen before. I should do that more often, I think it would be nice to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve also been super nervous and stressed out because I had to block one of my friends. I basically was just tired of them not talking to me and all that, despite them being actively online. I mean, how does one not have 5 minutes of time to talk to someone in the span of weeks, right? This was going on for months and months, and they didn’t do anything to fix it, so I’m not gonna do anything to keep things going either. There’s much more to it than that, but that’s not really in the scope of this catch-up post. I just wanted to share it because it’s something that’s been nagging at me for a few days now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to write less bloaty content for the website, and I also want to add more things to it. I don’t want to bloat (I say “bloat” a lot, huh?) the website with random garbage, but I want stuff that I think would be fun to include, so I’m just brainstorming stuff right now. If anyone is actually reading this, you can also e-mail me ideas or DM me on Discord or something. But yeah, hopefully new things will come in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, thanks for reading, and I hope you have a good day :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>True Selves</title>
      <link>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/true-selves/</link>

      <guid>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/true-selves/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about things tonight like I always do and something interesting that I thought about is the fact that there are so many layers and factors to take into account when looking at people. A lot of people define others based on factors like looks, external actions, etc. And no, I&amp;rsquo;m not about to go Kanye mode and say Hitler was good or something. I just mean that when we look at people, we can&amp;rsquo;t really know their true character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can get a basic idea because the traits that are the most prominent of theirs are probably on display, if that makes sense. But I suppse someone could just cover up said traits with a facade. How would I know someone is a huge golf fan without them telling me if they don&amp;rsquo;t make it obvious through their dialogue or clothing or whatnot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like it is possible for someone to expose their full self and their true feelings if they really wanted to. But the issue is to make sense of something like that, you&amp;rsquo;d have to consider their ENTIRE life and background in order for every single piece to fall into place, unless you resort to making assumptions, which isn&amp;rsquo;t true to their own true self. There are things people hide about themselves that could probably never be revealed, for better or worse. And the traits that people do hide are always probably bad ones, whether they know for a fact those things are not acceptable by societal standards, or their own standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there ever &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; a way to truly know a person? I feel like the reason I bring this up is because while I never mentioned it or tried to think of it that way, subconsciously, that&amp;rsquo;s what I made this website to do. This website acts as a somewhat personal diary, revealing aspects of myself that are true to me. I reveal my likes, dislikes, day to day activities, my fears and anxieties, and more. But even then, even if I am absolutely truthful about myself, I will never be able to fully reveal my true self to anyone, both because of things I and others would not accept, and because to include all factors of what make me myself and what factors have to be taken into account as for how I feel when I make a specific post would be pretty hard, or impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what I want to say at this point anymore. I had a concept and a thought in mind, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to put it into words. And this thought is not something I just thought of, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure everyone has. I just wanted to talk about it because I thought it was really interesting and I want to try to put my deeper more abstract thoughts into words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was really nice to type out. Have a good night, and sorry for my delusional rant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kindle: Rekindling My Desire to Read</title>
      <link>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/kindle-rekindling-my-desire-to-read/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 18:18:06 -0700</pubDate>

      <guid>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/kindle-rekindling-my-desire-to-read/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure somebody already used that pun but still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a couple of days before posting for the first time on this blog, during Black Friday Week, I finally gave into Kindle shilling after wanting to do something about not reading and bought a Kindle Paperwhite 2021 model off of Amazon for 100 dollarinos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a bit, I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I guess it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea to get a Kindle unless I had the intention to read in the first place. One issue I had when getting it was how difficult it is to read just regular chapters of manga on the Kindle. Instead, reading volumes of manga is more convenient since they&amp;rsquo;re all compiled and stuff. After a while though, I finally got other books, mainly Akira and Infinite Jest on there, although I do plan on getting other books on there as well. I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched Infinite Jest too much since its like 1000 pages and it&amp;rsquo;s sort of intimidating (although I&amp;rsquo;ll get to it eventually I promise), but I did start Akira, and the experience is very good. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading before I go to bed, so the blue light feature really helps a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, don&amp;rsquo;t buy shit you don&amp;rsquo;t know if you&amp;rsquo;ll need for sure, but I think this ended up going well for me and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I bought the Kindle, because at least now I have more motivation to read unlike before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy a Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must please Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodnight :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I was hoping this kinda wouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen. You know how you can&amp;rsquo;t use personality #27 in front of friend group #5? Well, this website being on my Discord exposed it. Was kinda hoping this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen, but not much I can do now. If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this (you know who you are), uh…. Hi. Hope your day&amp;rsquo;s been good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, here&amp;rsquo;s a cool song that I wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BHa5Qs9KK0g&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it a lot. Maybe I should share more music I like every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are people I would not like to be associated with that are actively making me feel worse and I do not want to be involved with them. Why do I feel this way&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Realized that I didn&amp;rsquo;t post yesterday. Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind too much because I think I want to try to actually make good content rather than fulfil a deadline and make shitposts. Anyways, today was a wild day, I saw a hit and run with a guy on a motorcycle and other stuff too, it was kinda chaotic and I think I need to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to posting, I might start not posting as often so that I have time to craft better posts. Maybe I will still shitpost since it&amp;rsquo;s fun but I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Next post might be a review of something. Not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hugo or Jekyll?</title>
      <link>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/hugo-or-jekyll/</link>

      <guid>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/hugo-or-jekyll/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m debating whether I should go through the effort of learning Jekyll and porting my site to that, or sticking with Hugo. I heard from my good friend realjame that Jekyll (the gen he uses for his blog) is better to him after he tried using Hugo because of the convenience of the tools, but it could just be that he&amp;rsquo;s used to it. I&amp;rsquo;ll think on this a little more. In the meantime, I should worry about more important things like school, since finals are starting now for me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wanted to write a lot earlier, but honestly I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel like it right now, I&amp;rsquo;m just kind of burnt out from working on my art stuff and just doing nothing. Good night.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More Rain</title>
      <link>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/more-rain/</link>

      <guid>http://nick64.me/diary/2022/12/more-rain/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a really nice day. It actually rained a lot more than I thought, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d only rain for the morning, but it rained the whole day, which was really refreshing and set a good mood for me. I also worked on the website and fixed some RSS stuff, worked on my new project (which I won&amp;rsquo;t say much about right now hehe), and also got more letters from colleges. One college sent me a &amp;ldquo;handwritten&amp;rdquo; letter that was just printed for the whole message except for my name on the top. The address was written too, but they spelt my name wrong. How special. It was good though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I also watched Blair Witch Project. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to open my horizons when it comes to movies since I never watched a lot as a kid, but I liked it a lot. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a lot of movies and getting into new stuff recently in order to give myself a broader sense of my own self and the world. Hopefully it helps with coming up with inspritation for projects I want to make, but A) I have major commitment issues when it comes to those, and B) I&amp;rsquo;m getting off-topic here. Blair Witch Project was really good, the style of it was unique and helped set a good atmosphere, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that YouTube horror series and other stuff has conditioned me to fear old 4:3 analog video, so it made it that much more scary hahaha&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it was a great day. I hope you reading this right now had one too. And if not, things will get better! Hopefully. Kidding, haha. Anyways, good night. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a beautiful rainy day where I’m at right now. No sunlight, all clouds, rain pouring down. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is a nice day for me. I personally don’t like the sun too much. Especially here in Arizona, where it gets so hot and all. When it rains, it’s really refreshing, especially growing up in Washington, where there’s a lot more rain than here. I think a reason I like the rain more is just the atmosphere of it. Rain is honestly really beautiful to me, something about the tippity tappity of the rain on the earth and grayness of the clouds and the amplified coziness of my home now that I’m sheltered from the rain feels really nice. Sunlight is fine too, but I don’t find it all that interesting. Maybe it’s just because I’m saying this as someone who goes outside a lot, but only really for school and work and other stuff, I don’t go out for the sake of going out a lot, so I don’t enjoy things like that. But oh well. Anyways, just wanted to write about that because I really enjoy this day of rain. I hope all of you reading this enjoy your days too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For real though, no more weird posts for a sec. Sorry for not saying a lot recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with school and work and&amp;hellip; life, in general. I want to work on the website, and I will still be posting daily here, but fixes and adding new stuff will be kind of slow for a while. I hope to get to it as soon as possible, but at the same time, I also need to work on other projects as well. I wanted to use this website to host said projects, so I should probably get to them now that I have a site to put them on lol. I should also post more art here from my old Twitter sometime. But yeah, have a wonderful day guys, and to those reading, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally got the Gurren Lagann box set in my mail today after ordering it on the RightStufAnime Black Friday sale and waiting a week for it to arrive. Being my first Aniplex box set, DAMN was it expensive. But it was worth it, it&amp;rsquo;s really nice. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished the series yet but I wanted it because it was fire. Will waste more moneyz on future box sets in the future.&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;img style=&#34;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;max-width:600px;max-height:auto;&#34; src=&#34;images/gurrenlagann.png&#34;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the intro video here :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m about to go to work, but this was a thought I had for a bit every once in a while. My boss will sometimes say not to do something, and somehow, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how he does it, he sounds serious, but also sounds like he&amp;rsquo;s joking at the same time. The past few times he&amp;rsquo;s done this to me, I was yawning because I work later in the day, and he said &amp;ldquo;No yawning!&amp;rdquo; in that same way I mentioned before. I genuinely can&amp;rsquo;t tell if he seriously means it or not. It sounds like such a silly thing to not allow, but at the same time that feels like something that would be frowned on by the higher ups of where I work at (a retail store, for context). I&amp;rsquo;m about to go into work in half an hour, but I just wanted to write about it because it was sort of confusing and I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what to think of it, haha&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s just a funny thing to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, I created this shitty website. Thus the homepage and the template were completed in their subpar looks. By the twenty-seventh day I had finished the work I had been doing; so on the twenty-seventh day I rested forever and ever from all this work. Then I blessed the twenty-seventh day and made it awesome, because on it I rested from all the work of creating I had done by watching anime and YouTube the whole day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, yeah this is the first post on my blog. I wish it was more monumental, but honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not even writing this for anyone more than I am writing it for myself. This post is just kickstarting the blog, more or less. I plan on writing here daily, or at least, as daily as I can handle, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how well that commitment goes. But right now, the site isn&amp;rsquo;t even live at the time of posting, so who knows when it&amp;rsquo;ll go online so that others can see posts like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, for anyone who may or may not be reading this, enjoy the website. It&amp;rsquo;s still under construction, but I&amp;rsquo;m gonna do my best to make it really good and fun to browse. I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding more over time and also begin posting other stuff like art and other projects here (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next post :)&lt;/p&gt;
